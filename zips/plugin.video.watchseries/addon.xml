        <description>Get the latest shows on website Watchseries-Online(.pl/.nl/.la...) allows for searching, saving
            shows, auto-playing from source specified in the settings by you, and also can filter results, and sort
            sources. This is the refactored version based off my WSONLINE plugin but I've cleaned the code up a lot and
            moved to KODISWIFT from the XBMCSWIFT2 framework. Below is the previous changes since the first version of
            this code.
            [B]v2.0.0[/B] Updated hostname to watchseries-online.be v1.9.5 Fix Autoplay not marking source item as watched. v1.9.3 AutoPlay feature for your prefer host
            tries to find first link matching your preferred host and play it. 1.8.3 up More bugfixes. 1.8: Fixed a
            problem with addon only returning 1 result due to a change in the HTML of the WatchSeries-Online Website
            V1.7.1 2017-05-06 Added filter results settings V1.6.9 Minor fixes/changes to make Save Show and Remove show
            work better. Make Search Show work as currently doesn't. V1.5 2017-2-20: Parsers have been added to attempt
            to grab details out of the name of the show such as the date, episode number and season. Formats the
            listings to be standard for easy sorting and reading through including color to make date stand out. V1.2.0
            2018-02-14: New playback and video file resolving fixing many bugs. Source Sorting and fave sources can be
            set in settings. Updated to new watchseries-online host which is currently .PL and added this as a setting
            that can be changed in the addon so I don't have to release an update each time they move servers.
