  <description lang="en">[B]V1.2.0[/B] Added new Search History to store previous searches as YouTube addon does. Plan to improve search to recognize Seasons in next update. Currently you can access a specific season by searching for the exxact show name and season number as it appears in the URL after swatchseries.to/serie/[B]show_name/season-2[/B] in the search put: show_name/season-2 to get season 2 episodes. Hope to automate this in future updates but it's a work around. Also Partially renamed to by adding SwatchSeries.TO in the name as it's been the URL for a while now. Actual plugin name still wsOVF. Updated the Simpleplugin Framework to new Python3 version, amazing developer RomanVM many thanks!!
    V1.1.0 Renamed from old TVSeries4U addon which died long ago. Fixed changes made to watchseries websites that broke addon. Uses the ROMANVM SimplePlugin micro-framework to scrape links from watchseries.ovf</description>
